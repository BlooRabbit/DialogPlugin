# DialogPlugin
Godot plugin for creating dialog jsons

This Godot plugin is designed to create json files containing dialogs, based on a visual nodes system. 
The json files are in the format designed by Levrault for his editor, which can be found here: https://github.com/Levrault/LE-dialogue-editor
They can be read by a dialog reader scene as explained here: https://github.com/BlooRabbit/DialogueNode

The visual node system allows for dialog nodes, conditional nodes, choice nodes and signals nodes. 

Just install the plugin in the addon folder and enable it in the Godot editor settings.
