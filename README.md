# DialogPlugin
Godot plugin for creating dialog jsons

This Godot plugin is designed to create json files containing dialogs, based on a visual nodes system. 
The json files are in the format designed by Levrault for his standalone editor, which can be found here, along with a lot of explanations: https://github.com/Levrault/LE-dialogue-editor
The files can be read by a simple Godot dialog scene and adapted to your needs as explained here: https://github.com/BlooRabbit/DialogueNode

**Use**

The visual node system allows for dialog nodes, conditional nodes, choice nodes and signals nodes. 

Start by creating a "new file", which will add a root node. Then plugin whatever other nodes you want. "print" prints out the json to your console.
Don't forget to save your file !

The plugin currently supports two languages, but it is pretty easy to add other languages, once you understand the way it works.

**Install**

Just install the plugin in the addon folder and enable it in the Godot editor settings.

The plugin is work in progress. It is still pretty raw and I will probably add more features in the future.
